# One tricky feature is that updates to the variable containing the dictionary
# happen only when the body of the dict update command finishes, and the key-value
# pairs not mapped by this subcommand are left untouched. This makes the behaviour
# of the system much easier to understand when a complex update is being performed

# Get the contents of the variable after the dict update command has completed;
# note it is different in several respects, but the value for 'title' is
# unchanged because that key was not listed at the start of the command
